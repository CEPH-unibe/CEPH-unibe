## Climate Epidemiology and Public Health (CEPH)
The Climate Epidemiology and Public Health research team aims to combine knowledge and methods in environmental epidemiology, public health, and climate sciences to develop innovative research that will help advance evidence on the impacts of climate change on human health.

Our research focuses on high-priority topics today in climate epidemiology, namely, health impact attribution studies, projections of health impacts under climate change scenarios and assessment of health impacts of climate-related hazards and compound weather events (i.e., ACTUAL project). We explore new datasets and methods to enhance our understanding of human vulnerabilities to extreme weather events and hazards. The team also collaborates with regional and local stakeholders to develop tools for improving adaptation to climate change (i.e., NCCS-impacts Health project). We are also collaborating with renowned experts from other fields on urban health, heat warning systems and weather forecasts. Finally, our research also focuses on highly vulnerable populations to climate change, such as mental health patients, older adults and pregnant women.


The group is a member of the [Multi-City Multi-Country Collaborative Research Network](https://mccstudy.lshtm.ac.uk/), and the [Oeschger Center of Climate Change Research](https://www.oeschger.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) of the University of Bern.
